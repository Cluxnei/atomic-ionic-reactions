# Atomic Ionic Reactions Simulation

This is a simple chemical ionic reaction simulation between two or more atoms making visual molecules

Demo available on:

https://cluxnei.com/projects/atomic-ionic-reactions/

- This simulation use FIXED RADIUS to represent atom's cores.
- Uses Columb law (with customized K constant) to compute attraction between particles considering atom's tendence to stable itself as well as it's charge
- When atoms collide the ionic reaction is applyed
- When the reaction is done, the atoms stay connected and behave in group (molecule)
