# Atomic Ionic Reactions Simulation

This is a simple chemical ionic reaction simulation between two or more atoms making visual molecules

Demo available on:

https://cluxnei.com/projects/atomic-ionic-reactions/

- This simulation use FIXED RADIUS to represent atom's cores.
- Use Columb law (with customized K constant) to compute attraction between particles
- Consider atom's tendence to be stable and it's charge to apply Columb law
- Do the ionic reaction when atoms collide
-  When the reaction is done, the atoms stay connected and behave in group
